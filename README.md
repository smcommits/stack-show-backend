## Development Information

- Active Records
- ActiveModel Serializer
- Action Cable
- Action Controller

To know more about API only application in Rails please refer to the [Rails Guides.](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html)
### API

- CRUD Operations
- Data persistence 
- Authentication
- Serialization
- WebSocket channels and subscriptions
- Caching

### Tests

This application uses rspec-rails to implement the tests. Additionaly, shoulda-matchers are used to implement assertions for ActiveRecord Assosiations and Validations. 

To run the tests, please use the following command:
```
rspec
